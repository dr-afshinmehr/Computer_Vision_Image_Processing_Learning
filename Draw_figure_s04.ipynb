The ellipse drawn in this line of code starts from coordinates \"490, 383\" and is drawn from the sides with values of \"140, 80\". The third component, **\"90\"**, determines the amount of rotation, the fourth component, **\"0\"**, removes a slice of the ellipse by the specified angle, to see the result of changing this number, set it to **\"45, 90, and 180\"**, the next component is **\"360\"**, the full amount. It determines the ovality and its function is the opposite of the previous component, the last two components are used to determine the color, fullness and thickness as before."
